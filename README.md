# Compsci-app-project
This is a PWA project for AP computer science, using HTML5, Javascript, and CSS. Anyone can view, edit, or fork this code.

(Forking means using this code for different purposes)

//Terms include:
 DO NOT USE THIS CODE FOR YOUR OWN PROJECT, FORKING FOR THE APP PROJECT COULD BE CONSIDERED ACADEMIC DISHONESTY; IT IS NOT ENCOURAGED.
//

There are a few notes that I would like to add for anyone committed to this project. 

1. This code is being re-used from a previous project of mine, you can upload any files or ideas that you would like. 
2. Some media (images for example) will not be re-used, but rather replaced with the *EXACT* same name as the previous media to prevent code errors. 
3. If you are not currently knowledgable of HTML or CSS, I can help, and a commonly used resource is https://www.w3schools.com.
