# Compsci-app-project
This is a PWA project for AP computer science, using HTML5, Javascript, and CSS. Anyone can view, edit, or fork this code.

(Forking means using this code for different purposes)

//Terms include:
 DO NOT USE THIS CODE FOR YOUR OWN PROJECT, FORKING FOR THE APP PROJECT COULD BE CONSIDERED ACADEMIC DISHONESTY; IT IS NOT ENCOURAGED.
//

There are a few notes that I would like to add for anyone committed to this project. 

1. This code is being re-used from a previous project of mine, you can upload any files or ideas that you would like. Therefore, the term "restauraunt" and "St. Augustine travel guide" is irrelevant; this was for FBLA, and I have full consent from Mr. Kahler for re-using FLBA code.
2. Some media (images for example) will not be re-used, but rather replaced with the *EXACT* same name as the previous media to prevent code errors. 
3. If you are not currently knowledgable of HTML or CSS, I can help, and a commonly used resource is https://www.w3schools.com. 
4. The code is not guaranteed to properly execute if you have not used the zip file to execute the code. With the GitHub repo, not everything is in the correct place just yet.
